# üéµ Sound Your Scene - chatbot that finds music by mood, not metadata

[Click here to try this app - for a limited time!](http://soundyourscene.hirenotes.com/).<br/>
[Feedback and ideas welcome here](https://forms.gle/vtFnqH4F8oLQVrxi7)

This chatbot uses audio analysis of songs so you can search them by vibe. You can use a mood ("sad"), a purpose ("dancing"), a genre ("hip hop"), an era ("80s"), and even specific ranges for BPM (e.g. 90-120) and duration (e.g. "2-4 minutes"). You can add an image to help the bot understand the scene even better. This should be useful for finding music choices for a movie, TV show, or video game soundtrack.

## üöÄ Workflow

This demo relies on [an open source dataset of about 18,000 songs from Youtube that were matched to their Spotify track ID](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/salvatorerastelli/spotify-and-youtube), created 2/7/2023. This is just around 0.02% of the Spotify catalog, but still represents a sufficient selection of popular tracks. This data set was enriched with more metadata from Spotify, including audio analysis features. An LLM agent built leveraging the [Gemini API](https://ai.google.dev/) ingests the user's query and converts it to a set of filters and weights that are applied to the dataset. The LLM queries the data iteratively to refine the results, both autonomously and with user input.

## üîß How this was built

I first built a [Python Notebook](/notebooks/music-exploration.ipynb) to demo the concept end to end. Then, with the help of AI tools (Claude Code and Cursor) I converted this demo to a full stack web app, with a Python FastAPI back end, React front end, Postgres for persistence, and Redis for caching.

## üöÄ Features

### Core Functionality
- **Natural Language Search**: Describe any mood or scene in plain English
- **Image Search**: You can upload an optional image to further convey the mood you're searching for. Great if you're looking for selections for a film, TV series, or video game
- **AI-Powered Matching**: Google Gemini converts your query to a set of filters and weights, and then iteratively refines its search model based on results sample
- **Rich Audio Analysis**: Leverages Spotify's comprehensive audio feature set
- **Multi-Platform Results**: Integrated Spotify and YouTube links for each track

### Production Features
- **Scalable Architecture**: PostgreSQL database with Redis caching
- **Rate Limiting**: Smart protection against API abuse
- **Real-time Processing**: Background job processing with WebSocket-like polling
- **User Analytics**: Comprehensive tracking for search behavior and engagement
- **Playlist Management**: Create and share custom playlists
- **Email Integration**: Share playlists via email with security measures
- **Image Context**: Upload images to provide visual context for music searches
- **Performance Monitoring**: Built-in system health and performance metrics

## üéØ Use Cases

- **Film & TV**: Find the perfect soundtrack for specific scenes
- **Content Creation**: Discover music that matches your video's mood
- **Game Development**: Source atmospheric music for different game states
- **Personal Discovery**: Explore music based on feelings rather than genres
- **DJs**: You can already give the chatbot specific BPM ranges, scales and modes coming soon

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture
