    "Below is a list of features we can use to filter as well as to create a relevance score. Note many of these are correlated. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the following features, you can create min/max filters and also a weight for relevance scoring.\n",
    "danceability_decile: Danceability describes how suitable a track is for dancing. The higher the number the higher the dancability. Converted to deciles (1-10).\n",
    "speechiness_decile: Speechiness detects the presence of spoken words in a track. The more exclusively speech-like the recording (e.g. talk show, audio book, poetry), the higher the attribute value. Converted to deciles (1-10).\n",
    "energy_decile: represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy. For example, death metal has high energy, while a Bach prelude scores low on the scale. Converted to deciles (1-10).\n",
    "acousticness_decile: A confidence measure of whether the track is acoustic. The higher the number the higher the confidence. Converted to deciles (1-10).\n",
    "instrumentalness_decile: Predicts whether a track contains no vocals. \"Ooh\" and \"aah\" sounds are treated as instrumental in this context. Rap or spoken word tracks are clearly \"vocal\". The higher the instrumentalness value is, the greater likelihood the track contains no vocal content. Deciles are not balanced and start at 5 for definitely vocal tracks, max is 10.\n",
    "liveness_decile: Detects the presence of an audience in the recording. Higher liveness values represent an increased probability that the track was performed live. Converted to deciles (1-10).\n",
    "valence_decile: A measure describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry). Converted to deciles (1-10).\n",
    "views_decile: the number of YouTube views the music has. Converted to deciles (1-10).\n",
    "tempo: The overall estimated tempo of a track in beats per minute (BPM). Consider BPMs under 60 ultra slow and hard to detect a beat. 60-90 are slow with a beat detectable. 90-120 are mid tempo/pop. 120-140 are fast and upbeat. 140 and above is very fast. Min/max filters are not applied against deciles but againt the raw value. The score weight will be multiplied by the decile.\n",
    "loudness: The overall loudness of a track in decibels (dB). Loudness values are averaged across the entire track and are useful for comparing relative loudness of tracks. Note that overall loudness is normalized across tracks on Spotify, so only use this in extreme scenarios. Min/max filters are not applied against deciles but againt the raw value. The score weight will be multiplied by the decile.\n",
    "duration_ms: the duration of the track in milliseconds. Always ensure to provide at least 3 seconds of a range if you use this filter. Min/max filters are not applied against deciles but againt the raw value. The score weight will be multiplied by the decile.\n",

    "album_release_year: the year the track was released in, represented as an integer. This is the year the recording was made, do not rely on this for classical music or any music from before 1950. \n",
    "track_is_explicit: this is 0 for tracks without explicit language and 1 for tracks marked as explicit language. \n",
    "key: the key the track is in. Only use this if the user explictly asks for it. 0 is C, 1 is C# or Db, 2 is D, 3 is D# or Eb, 4 is E, 5 is F, 6 is F# or Gb, 7 is G, 8 is G# or Ab, 9 is A, 10 is A# or Bb, 11 is B.\n",

Note that any filtering will only apply to the 60% of tracks that have genres. Only use this field if the user gives a clear indication of style or genre required. \n",
    "Values you can choose and are common are: pop, rock, r&b, hip hop, rap, edm, house, reggaeton, latin, country, k-pop, bollywood, metal, disco, orchestra, classical.\n",
    "Values you can choose that are more rare: ambient, soundtrack, lo-fi, drum and bass, christmas, children, anime, emo, piano. Use these sparingly. \n",
    "There are a lot more genres but they are even more rare. Only use a genre outside the list above if the user explicitly asks for it. \n",
    "spotify_artist_genres_include_any: Provide a comma separated string to filter in tracks that have at least one of your genres included. If you include a substring like pop it will also capture genres like k-pop. Be as general as possible. If you use more niche genres, make sure to widen other filters. \n",
    "spotify_artist_genres_exclude_any: Provide a comma separated string to filter out tracks that have any of your genres included. If you exclude a substring like pop it will also exclude genres like k-pop. Be as specific as possible. Use sparingly. \n",
    "spotify_artist_genres_boosted: Provide a comma separated string to give a 50 point relevance score boost to tracks that have any included genre. Artists with multiple included genres will get multiple boosts. \n",

The key decisions involved tightening filters based on implicit user intent for 'songs' and quality. I maintained the explicit `key` (B) and `tempo` (100-120 BPM) ranges as hard filters. To reduce the count and improve quality, I applied `views_min_decile=4` to filter for tracks with at least moderate popularity, and `instrumentalness_min_decile=5` and `instrumentalness_max_decile=7` to ensure tracks are primarily vocal ('songs') and not heavily instrumental. These filters exclude tracks that are less viewed or predominantly instrumental, which tend to be outside the general expectation for 'songs'. Additionally, I introduced positive relevance weights for `danceability` (20), `energy` (20), `valence` (10), and especially `views` (30). These weights aim to sort more engaging, positive, and popular tracks higher, ensuring the top results are of high quality and broad appeal.

This ensures that only artists explicitly tagged with 'j-pop' are considered, directly addressing the user's feedback. The instrumentalness and speechiness filters remain high/low respectively to meet the 'fully instrumental' requirement. Views decile minimum is kept at 5 to maintain quality by favoring popular tracks. All other filters remain broad as they were not specified. The most important filter change was the genre filter. If the result count becomes too low with this stricter genre, I would consider slightly relaxing the 'instrumentalness_min_decile' to 8, or reducing the 'views_min_decile' to 3 or 4, but only if quality doesn't degrade. Alternatively, I could investigate if 'japanese pop' or other similar terms might exist in the genre data and broaden the genre filter carefully again.</p>\n",
