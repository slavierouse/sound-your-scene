    "The music database has the following features we can filter on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Features already converted to deciles you can use for min/max filters and for scores.\n",
    "danceability: Danceability describes how suitable a track is for dancing. The higher the number the higher the dancability.\n",
    "speechiness: Speechiness detects the presence of spoken words in a track. The more exclusively speech-like the recording (e.g. talk show, audio book, poetry), the higher the attribute value. \n",
    "energy: represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy. For example, death metal has high energy, while a Bach prelude scores low on the scale.\n",
    "acousticness: A confidence measure of whether the track is acoustic. The higher the number the higher the confidence. \n",
    "instrumentalness: Predicts whether a track contains no vocals. \"Ooh\" and \"aah\" sounds are treated as instrumental in this context. Rap or spoken word tracks are clearly \"vocal\". The higher the instrumentalness value is, the greater likelihood the track contains no vocal content. Deciles are not balanced and start at 5 for definitely vocal tracks, max is 10.\n",
    "liveness: Detects the presence of an audience in the recording. Higher liveness values represent an increased probability that the track was performed live.\n",
    "valence: A measure describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry).\n",
    "views: the number of YouTube views the music has.\n",
    "\n",
    "Numeric features you can use directly for min/max filters and in deciles for scores:\n",
    "tempo: The overall estimated tempo of a track in beats per minute (BPM). Consider BPMs under 60 ultra slow and hard to detect a beat. 60-90 are slow with a beat detectable. 90-120 are mid tempo/pop. 120-140 are fast and upbeat. 140 and above is very fast.\n",
    "loudness: The overall loudness of a track in decibels (dB). Loudness values are averaged across the entire track and are useful for comparing relative loudness of tracks. Note that overall loudness is normalized across tracks on Spotify, so only use this in extreme scenarios. \n",
    "duration_ms: the duration of the track in milliseconds. Always ensure to provide at least 3 seconds of a range if you use this filter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Numeric features you can only use as min/max filters:\n",
    "album_release_year: the year the track was released in, represented as an integer. This is the year the recording was made, do not rely on this for classical music or any music from before 1950. \n",
    "track_is_explicit: this is 0 for tracks without explicit language and 1 for tracks marked as explicit language. \n",
    "\n",
    "String features you can provide filters and scoring for:\n",
    "spotify_artist_genres: the genre associated with the artist. Many artists are not associated with a genre, so use this field only if the user gives a clear indication of style or genre required. \n",

    "Values you can choose that are more rare: ambient, soundtrack, lo-fi, drum and bass, christmas, children, anime, emo, piano. Use these sparingly. \n",
    "There are a lot more genres but many are niche, only use a different one if the user explicitly asks for it. \n",
    "spotify_artist_genres_include_any: Provide a comma separated string to filter in tracks that have at least one of your genres included. If you include a substring like pop it will also capture genres like k-pop. Be as general as possible. If you use more niche genres, make sure to widen other filters. \n",
    "spotify_artist_genres_exclude_any: Provide a comma separated string to filter out tracks that have any of your genres included. If you exclude a substring like pop it will also exclude genres like k-pop. Be as specific as possible. Use sparingly. \n",
    "spotify_artist_genres_boosted: Provide a comma separated string to give a 50 point relevance score boost to tracks that have any included genre. Artists with multiple included genres will get multiple boosts. \n",
    "\n",
    "Please return JSON following the schema provided.\n",
    "Attributes with a min or max in the name will create a filter for the user. \n",
    "Attributes with weight or boost in the name will contribute to a relevance score to sort results. \n",
    "The weight will be multiplied by the decile of that feature to create the score.\n",
    "Please make it a number between -100 and 100.\n",
    "Attributes with include all, include any, or exclude will create a filter for the user.\n",
